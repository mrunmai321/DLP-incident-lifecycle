# DLP Incident Lifecycle Simulation

## Overview
This project demonstrates how a cybersecurity analyst handles Data Loss Prevention (DLP) incidents â€” from alert triage to documentation. It uses simulated data and workflows based on real-life scenarios with Microsoft Defender and McAfee DLP.

## Tools
- Microsoft Defender DLP
- McAfee DLP
- ServiceNow
- Excel/Word for reports

## Folders
- `simulation_data/`: Dummy test files that could trigger DLP alerts.
- `triage_workflow/`: Flowcharts and SOP-style steps to handle incidents.
- `reports/`: Sample monthly DLP report and incident report template.
- `rule_tuning/`: Documents showing how to reduce false positives.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Incident triage & documentation
- DLP rule tuning
- Reporting & SLA tracking
