# DLP-incident-lifecycle
This project simulates the lifecycle of a DLP (Data Loss Prevention) incident in a corporate environment. It includes how a DLP Analyst triages, investigates, escalates, and reports on alerts. The project is based on common use cases involving data types like PII, credit card numbers, and sensitive internal documents.
